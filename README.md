# CS300-DSA-Analysis-and-Design

**Project Overview**
   The projects in this course focused on analyzing and implementing data structures to solve practical programming problems. In Project One, I compared different data structures to evaluate their runtime and memory efficiency, determining which was best for managing course information in an advising program. In Project Two, I built a C++ program that reads course data from a file, stores it in memory, and prints a list of Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order.

**Problem Solved**
   The main problem I was solving was creating an efficient way for advisors to look up courses and prerequisites quickly. To do this, I had to understand how each data structure affects performance and storage. I compared vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees to decide which option offered the fastest lookups and sorting while using memory effectively.
   
   I ran into some challenges while testing file input and handling data formatting. I resolved these issues by working step by step, testing smaller parts of the program before combining everything. Clear naming, comments, and structured logic helped prevent confusion and made debugging easier.

**Impact on Software Design**
  This project changed how I approach software design by showing how important it is to think about structure and efficiency early in development. Choosing the right data structure can make a big difference in how a program performs and scales.
  
   I learned the importance of writing programs that are clean, organized, and easy to understand. I now focus on clarity, modular functions, consistent naming, and detailed comments to make code easier to maintain and update. These practices help ensure the program remains adaptable for future changes.
